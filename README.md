# `fennel-markov`

A simple Markov chain generator in Fennel. To use it, place a list of
space-separated words in `words`, and then run:

    $ fennel main.fennel <words

The program will then generate a new word that looks like one of the words in
the file.

This project was just for fun, to learn about Fennel and Markov chains. It
isn't useful for anything.
